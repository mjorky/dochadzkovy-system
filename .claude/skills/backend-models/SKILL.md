name: Backend Models
description: Define and structure database models using Prisma schema, Drizzle schemas, or TypeScript interfaces for existing PostgreSQL databases. When creating or modifying database models and their relationships. When defining model fields, constraints, and data types in Prisma schema files. When creating TypeScript interfaces to represent existing database tables that can't be modified. When working with fixed database schemas using GraphQL object types. When setting up relationships between models. When mapping database column names to application property names. When implementing model-level validation or default values.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing Prisma model definitions in schema.prisma files
- When working with Drizzle table schemas and definitions
- When creating TypeScript interfaces to represent existing database tables
- When defining GraphQL object types that map to database tables
- When working with existing fixed database schemas that can't be modified via ORM
- When mapping database column names (PascalCase, snake_case) to application properties (camelCase)
- When defining model fields, data types, and constraints
- When setting up relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- When adding database constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, or foreign keys
- When implementing timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt, StartDate, etc.) on models
- When adding indexes to foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- When choosing appropriate data types that match data requirements
- When defining cascade behaviors for relationships
- When implementing multi-layer validation (model and database levels)
- When working with NestJS entities, DTOs, or GraphQL types that represent database models
