name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement comprehensive error handling across both backend and frontend. When implementing error handling in NestJS services, resolvers, or controllers. When creating custom exception types or error classes. When implementing centralized error handling at API boundaries. When handling GraphQL errors and providing user-friendly messages. When implementing error boundaries in React components. When adding retry strategies with exponential backoff for external service calls. When ensuring proper resource cleanup in error scenarios. When implementing graceful degradation for non-critical failures.

## When to use this skill

- When implementing error handling in NestJS services, controllers, or GraphQL resolvers
- When creating custom exception types or error classes (HttpException, GraphQLError, etc.)
- When implementing centralized error handling middleware or exception filters
- When handling and formatting GraphQL errors for client consumption
- When implementing React error boundaries for graceful frontend error handling
- When providing clear, user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details
- When failing fast with explicit validation and precondition checks
- When implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff for transient failures
- When ensuring resource cleanup (connections, file handles) in finally blocks
- When implementing graceful degradation when non-critical services fail
- When working with try-catch blocks in async functions
- When handling errors in Next.js error.tsx or global error handlers
