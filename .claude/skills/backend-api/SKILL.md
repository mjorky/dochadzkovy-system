name: Backend API
description: Design and implement GraphQL APIs using NestJS code-first approach with @nestjs/graphql or Apollo Server with schema-first approach. When creating or modifying GraphQL resolvers, queries, mutations, subscriptions, object types, input types, or any GraphQL schema files. When implementing GraphQL endpoints in NestJS services, Apollo Server resolvers, or service layers. When working with GraphQL subscriptions for real-time features via WebSocket. When structuring API responses and handling GraphQL-specific errors. When defining query parameters, filters, sorting, or pagination in GraphQL queries. When using schema-first with gql template literals or code-first with decorators. When versioning or managing GraphQL schema changes.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing GraphQL resolver files (*.resolver.ts, resolvers.ts)
- When defining GraphQL schema types, queries, mutations, or subscriptions
- When working with @nestjs/graphql decorators like @Query, @Mutation, @Subscription, @ObjectType, @InputType, @Field
- When using Apollo Server with schema-first approach and gql template literals (typeDefs)
- When implementing GraphQL resolvers with context, parent, and args parameters
- When implementing real-time features using GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket
- When structuring GraphQL API responses and implementing error handling
- When adding filtering, sorting, or pagination to GraphQL queries
- When versioning or managing breaking changes in the GraphQL schema
- When implementing rate limiting or authentication guards on GraphQL endpoints
- When working with NestJS services that power GraphQL resolvers
- When setting up Apollo Server with Express or standalone
- When defining GraphQL context with database connections or request information
