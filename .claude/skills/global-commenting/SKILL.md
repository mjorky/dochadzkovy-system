name: Global Commenting
description: Write minimal, helpful code comments that explain complex logic without cluttering the codebase. When adding comments to explain non-obvious code sections or complex algorithms. When documenting why certain decisions were made rather than what the code does. When writing evergreen comments that remain relevant long-term. When working with TypeScript, NestJS, or React code that benefits from explanatory comments. When avoiding comments about recent changes or temporary fixes.

## When to use this skill

- When writing comments to explain large sections of complex code logic
- When documenting why a particular approach was chosen (architectural decisions, workarounds)
- When adding concise, minimal comments that provide real value
- When ensuring comments are evergreen and won't become outdated quickly
- When avoiding comments that just restate what the code obviously does
- When working with TypeScript code where types already provide documentation
- When documenting complex algorithms or business logic that isn't self-explanatory
- When reviewing code to remove outdated or unnecessary comments
- When ensuring self-documenting code through clear structure and naming first
- When avoiding comments about recent changes, fixes, or TODO items (use git history or issue tracking instead)
