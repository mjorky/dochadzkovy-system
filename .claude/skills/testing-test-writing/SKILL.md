name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write strategic tests using Jest (backend) or Vitest with React Testing Library (frontend). When writing tests for critical user flows and core functionality. When creating unit tests for NestJS services, resolvers, or controllers. When writing component tests for React components. When testing GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions. When mocking external dependencies like databases or APIs. When focusing on behavior rather than implementation details. When writing minimal tests during feature development and deferring comprehensive coverage.

## When to use this skill

- When writing tests for critical user flows and primary workflows
- When creating Jest tests for NestJS backend services, resolvers, or controllers
- When writing Vitest tests with React Testing Library for frontend components
- When testing GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When focusing tests on behavior and outcomes rather than implementation
- When writing clear, descriptive test names that explain expected outcomes
- When keeping tests fast (milliseconds) for frequent execution
- When testing core functionality at logical completion points, not every intermediate step
- When deferring edge case and validation tests unless business-critical
- When working with test files (*.spec.ts, *.test.ts, *.spec.tsx, *.test.tsx)
- When running or debugging existing test suites
