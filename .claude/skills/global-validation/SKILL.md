name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive validation using Zod schemas across frontend forms and backend APIs. When implementing form validation with React Hook Form and Zod. When validating GraphQL input types in NestJS resolvers. When implementing server-side validation for API requests. When validating user input to prevent injection attacks. When providing clear, field-specific validation error messages. When implementing client-side validation for user experience. When validating business rules and data constraints.

## When to use this skill

- When implementing form validation with React Hook Form and Zod schemas
- When validating GraphQL input types and arguments in NestJS resolvers
- When implementing server-side validation for all API endpoints and mutations
- When creating Zod schemas for type-safe validation across the stack
- When providing clear, field-specific error messages for validation failures
- When implementing client-side validation for immediate user feedback
- When sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and command injection
- When validating data types, formats, ranges, and required fields
- When implementing business rule validation (e.g., date ranges, balance checks)
- When using allowlists to define what's permitted rather than blocking specific inputs
- When ensuring validation is consistent across all entry points (forms, APIs, background jobs)
- When validating early in the request flow to fail fast on invalid data
