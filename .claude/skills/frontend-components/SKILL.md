## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing React component files (.tsx)
- When working with Next.js App Router files (page.tsx, layout.tsx, route.tsx)
- When building reusable UI components with single responsibility
- When composing complex UIs from smaller, simpler components
- When using shadcn/ui components or creating custom component variants
- When defining component props with TypeScript interfaces and setting defaults
- When managing component state with React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- When implementing global state with Zustand store
- When creating forms with React Hook Form and Zod schema validation
- When fetching data from GraphQL APIs using Apollo Client, urql, or custom fetch-based clients
- When creating custom hooks for data fetching and mutations (e.g., useWorkRecords, useProjects)
- When handling loading states, errors, and refetching in components
- When encapsulating component logic and keeping internal details private
- When documenting component usage, props, and providing examples
- When working with server components vs. client components in Next.js
